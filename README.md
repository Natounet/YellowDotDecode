# YellowDotDecode
DotDecode is a graphical application that decodes the hidden information embedded in the yellow dots printed by some printers. These yellow dots, often invisible to the naked eye, contain metadata such as the date, time, and serial number of the printer, which can be used to trace the source of a printed document.
